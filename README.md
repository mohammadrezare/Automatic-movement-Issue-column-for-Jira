# Automatic movement Issue column for Jira
Github actions give us the ability to set a trigger for our events.
You can automatically update the column status of your Jira issues by using this yml file.
For instance, after the relevant branch is merged with the dev branch, you may want to move your issue to the QA stage.
This is great because it will increase production.
